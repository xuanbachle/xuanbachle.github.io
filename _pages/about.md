I'm Bach Le (also known in my publications as Xuan-Bach D. Le). I'm currently a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to U.S. Tenured Associate Professor) at the University of Melbourne, Australia. I was formerly an Australian Research Council DECRA Fellow (from 2022 to 2024). Previously, I was a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University, working with ACM Distinguished Scientist & Associate Prof. Corina Pasareanu. I received my PhD from Singapore Management University in June 2018, under supervision of ACM Distinguished Member & OUB Chair Professor David Lo.

My research mission is to make automated software debugging a central part of Software Engineering in ensuring high quality of software via the synergy of AI/data mining with automated reasoning techniques. My research interests span software engineering and programming languages, including: 
* Program Repair, Program Synthesis, Deductive Verification, Grammar-based Fuzzing, Multi-version Reasoning.
* Human-centered and AI-powered Debugging, e.g., empirical and human study, graph mining, LLMs and its application in neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Evidence of my research and supervision excellence includes:
* My students' awards: Harvard Postdoctoral Fellowship (2025), IEEE Distinguished Paper Award (2023), Google PhD Fellowship Award (2023), University Endeavor Award (2020, 2021), and Best Undergraduate Thesis Award (2022).
* My research's award: Australian Research Council DECRA Award 2022 (worth approx. 500K) by the Australian government.
