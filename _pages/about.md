I'm Bach Le (known in my publications as Xuan-Bach D. Le). I'm currently a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to U.S. Tenured Associate Professor) at the University of Melbourne, Australia. I am also an Australian Research Council DECRA Fellow (from 2022 to 2024). Previously, I was a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University, working with ACM Distinguished Scientist & Associate Prof. Corina Pasareanu. I received my PhD from Singapore Management University in June 2018, under supervision of ACM Distinguished Member & UOB Chair Professor David Lo.

My research interests span software engineering and programming languages, including: software mining, empirical software engineering, program analysis, repair, synthesis, and verification. Our work History Driven Program Repair inspired/influenced GetaFix by Facebook (See Section 6). GetaFix is the first ever automated repair tool deployed at large scale codebase in the industry. I enjoy building automated reasoning systems, such as deductive verification , symbolic execution and program synthesis , grammar-based fuzzing , and multi-version reasoning . Other than that, I also love building AI-powered systems that assist automated software debugging, such as graph-based mining of bug fix patterns, and prediction of efficiency of program repair . Lately, I enjoy supervising my PhD students to build human-centered and AI-powered debugging. Under my primary supervisions, my students won multiple prestigious prizes such as IEEE Distinguished Paper Award (2023), Google PhD Fellowship Award (2023), University Endeavor Award (2020, 2021), and Best Undergraduate Thesis Award (2019). My research has also been recognized with prestigious award from the Australian government such as the Australian Research Council DECRA Award 2022 (worth approx. 500K).

I am passionate about teaching and have been co-ordinating/lecturing on various subjects including theory subjects such as Models of Computation (600 students), Programing Languange Implementation - Compiler Theory (45 students), and practical subjects such as Software Project (130 students), Object-oriented Software Development (400 students).
